I started to build a website yesterday and to be honest... it looked...pitiful.
I am primarily a backend engineer and my CSS looked like...heck. I could have perfectly followed a tutorial and ended up with a beautiful website, but I learn by doing. And if I wait until it's perfect, it wont happen. So I'm accepting it looks a little rough, but I'm going to work on it a little every day and someday it might end up looking good.

...just like the ugly ducking.
